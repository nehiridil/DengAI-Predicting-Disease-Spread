# DengAI-Predicting-Disease-Spread
Predicting Dengue Fever cases using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Dengue fever is one of the most rapidly spreading diseases in the world. To create a system that can use the available relevant information about the factors responsible for the spread of dengue and use it to predict accurate forecasts the occurrence of dengue, so that public health experts can prepare for, manage and control the epidemic. To obtain the accurate forecasting of dengue cases, it is crucial to model the long-term dependency in time series data, which is difficult for a typical machine learning method. This project aimed to develop an accurate forecasting model of dengue based on neural networks while only considering previous dengue cases
and climate factors.
